# Code Refactor: Marketing Accessibility 
### For this challenge, the task at hand was to refactor the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing agency's, website. 

## User Story

As a marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO that our own site is optimized for search engines



## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title!
